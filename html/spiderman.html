            I love Spiderman in avenger beacuse of his strength and ability of climbing walls and
            flying over the city using a spiders web technology watch in his hand. most of the 
            children like him becuase that character is made for children. it has called the
            friendly neighbourhood Spiderman. To read more, <a href="https://g.co/kgs/ZXoh1D">click here</a>.

            The character Spiderman is made for children. I invite you all to see the next movie of
            Spiderman in RH Kunnamkulam.
